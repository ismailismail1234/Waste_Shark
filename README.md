Waste Shark – Remote Controlled Aquatic Cleaning Robot
📌 Project Overview

Waste Shark is a small-scale aquatic robot designed to collect floating waste from water surfaces such as lakes, ponds, or canals. The project demonstrates a proof-of-concept for low-cost environmental cleanup using embedded systems and remote control.

The robot is controlled wirelessly through a mobile application developed using RemoteXY, allowing real-time control and monitoring.

🧠 System Description

The system is based on a microcontroller that receives control commands from a smartphone via a RemoteXY interface. These commands are used to control the robot’s motion and operational behavior.

The project focuses on:

Remote navigation

Simple embedded control

Environmental cleanup concept validation
